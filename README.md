Animated cloth / Flag waving

![enter image description here](https://github.com/kellycode/flag-waving/raw/main/public_img.jpg)

Based on the Animation / Cloth Three.js experiment at https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_cloth

Organized the code to make it less cluttered and use classes.

Adapted the cloth to be pinned on any of the four sides.
